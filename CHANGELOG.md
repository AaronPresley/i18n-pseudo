## `v1.1.3`

My initial text expansion seemed a bit excessive, so I reduced to the following:

| Char Length | Previous Expansion | Updated Expansion |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| 0 thru 5    | 120%               | 100%              |
| 6 thru 10   | 100%               | 60%               |
| 11 thru 25  | 80%                | 40%               |
| 26 thru 50  | 60%                | 20%               |
| 51 thru 75  | 40%                | 0%                |
| 51+         | 20%                | 0%                |

Upcoming improvements will allow setting this expansion percentage through options. This will allow users to overwrite these defaults.
